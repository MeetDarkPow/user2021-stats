with Shiny, maintain a dashboard or provide business logic, but the 
codebase of your app becomes too complex? Then modules are the right 
tool for you, they are the Shiny built-in solution to manage this 
complexity. Shiny modules allow you to break down your code into smaller
 building blocks that can be combined and reused.
In this tutorial I give an introduction into 
modules, its advantages over simple R functions and how existing 
functionality can be transferred to modules.
For an easy start, I cover common pitfalls needed to overcome for a productive use of modules:
- Passing reactive objects to modules
- Returning reactive values from the module to the calling environment
- Nesting modules
- Dynamically generating modules (including UI)
The contents of the tutorial are delivered by 
short lectures followed by hands-on coding sessions in break-out rooms. 
For this, you need a basic knowledge of reactive programming/Shiny.",https://www.conftool.org/user2021/index.php?page=browseSessions&form_session=4#paperID306

keeping users in a natural environment, using a tool they know: a 
RMarkdown document. The step between writing your own R code to analyze 
some data and refactoring it into a well-documented, ready-to-share R 
package seems unreachable to many R users. The package structure is 
sometimes perceived as useful only for building general-purpose tools 
for data analysis to be shared on official platforms. However, packages 
can be used for a broader range of purposes, from internal use to 
open-source sharing. Because packages are designed for robustness and 
enforce helpful standards for documentation and testing, the package 
structure provides a useful framework for refactoring analyses and 
preparing them to go into production. The following approach to write a 
development or an analysis inside a Rmd, will significantly reduce the 
work to transform a Rmd into a package : - _Design_ : define the goal of
 your next steps and the tools needed to reach them - _Prototype_ : use 
some small examples to prototype your script in Rmd - _Build_ : Build 
your script as functions and document your work to be able to use them, 
in the future, on real-life datasets - _Strengthen_ : Create tests to 
assure stability of your code and follow modifications through time - 
_Deploy_ : Transform as a well-structured package to deploy and share 
with your community During this tutorial, we will work through the steps
 of Rmd Driven Development to persuade attendees that their experience 
writing R code means that they already know how to build a package. They
 only need to be in a safe environment to find it out, which will be 
what we propose. We will take advantage of all existing tools such as 
{devtools}, {testthat}, {attachment} and {usethis} that ease package 
development from Rmd to building a package. The recent package 
[{fusen}](https://thinkr-open.github.io/fusen), which ""inflates a 
package from a simple flat Rmd"", will be presented to further reduce the
 step between well-designed Rmd and package deployment. Attendees will 
leave this workshop having built their first package with the ""Rmd 
First"" method and with the skills and tools to build more packages on 
their own.",https://www.conftool.org/user2021/index.php?page=browseSessions&form_session=3#paperID313

does not matter whether you are working with raw data, cleaned data, or 
with the results of an analyses. It is always important to convince 
yourself that the data you are using is fit for its intended purpose. 
Since it is such a common task, why not automate it? The 'validate' 
package is designed for exactly this task: it implements a domain 
specific language for data checking that aims to encompass any check you
 might wish to perform. In this course you will will learn to define and
 measure data quality in a precise way with the validate package. We 
will focus on the main workflow, and show you how you can involve domain
 experts directly with your work, even if they do not know R. You will 
learn the main principles of data validation, both from the point of 
view of organizing a data processing work flow, as well as from a more 
formal perspective. You will exercise data validation tasks that range 
from checking input format and types to complex checks that involve data
 from multiple sources. You will learn how to follow the evolution of 
data quality as it is processed using the lumberjack package. And you 
will learn how to flush out redundant or contradictory quality demands 
using the validatetools package. The course will consist of hands-on 
work, based on a prepared tutorial that will be published on GitHub.

the next level by massively parallelizing your R code on a kubernetes 
cluster. We will show you how to move your entire data pipeline to 
Kubernetes where each node in the pipeline consists of a container 
running R code. These containers can run with multiple cores, and then 
farmed out to tens or hundreds of these containers running in parallel. 
Our experience has shown that this allows for massive speed gains, at 
relatively low cost when the kubernetes cluster is populated with 
ephemeral virtual machines (e.g. preemptible VM's on GCP - Spot 
instances on AWS). You need to have an interest in the more
 technical aspects of running R code, but only to a degree. We hope to 
dispel any fear that you might have that setting up a cluster is 
something that is very difficult. A 
key tool we will introduce is a tool to create data pipelines on 
kubernetes called Pachyderm (the open source version). The tutorial will be a combination of theory, break outs 
to run things hands on, regrouping to talk about experiences and then

You've come to the right place: This tutorial is about Advanced testing of R packages, with HTTP testing as a case study.
Unit tests have numerous advantages like 
preventing future breakage of your package and helping you define 
features (test-driven development).
In many introductions to package development 
you learn how to set up testthat infrastructure, and how to write a few 
âcute little testsâ 
(https://testthat.r-lib.org/articles/test-fixtures.html#test-fixtures) 
with only inline assertions.
This might work for a bit but soon you will 
encounter some practical and theoretical challenges: e.g. where do you 
put data and helpers for your tests? If your package is wrapping a web 
API, how do you test it independently from any internet connection? And 
how do you test the behavior of your package in case of API errors?
In this tutorial we shall use HTTP testing 
with the vcr package as an opportunity to empower you with more 
knowledge of testing principles (e.g. cleaning after yourself, testing 
error behavior) and testthat practicalities (e.g. testthat helper files,
 testthat custom skippers).
After this tutorial, you will be able to use 
the handy vcr package for your package wrapping a web API or any other 
web resource, but you will also have gained skills transferable to your 
other testing endeavours!

dense and sparse multidimensional arrays, as well as data frames. Large 
datasets can be stored on multiple backends ranging from a local 
filesystem to cloud storage providers such as Amazon S3 (as well Google 
Cloud Storage and Azure Cloud Storage) and accessed using almost any 
language, including Python and R. The tutorial introduces the 'tiledb' R
 package on CRAN, which allows users to efficiently operate on large 
dense/sparse arrays using familiar R techniques and data structures. It 
also offers key features of the underlying TileDB Embedded library: 
parallelised read and write operations, multiple compression formats, 
time traveling (i.e., the ability to recover data stored at previous 
timepoints), flexible encryption, and Apache Arrow support. Several 
simple usage examples will be provided and you will have an 
opportunity to follow along on your laptops. One or two fuller usage 
examples from Bioinformatics will serve as a more extended case study. 
We will illustrate how TileDB can be used to create a performant data 
store for results produced by Genome-Wide Association Studies, and 
demonstrate the BioConductor package, TileDBArray, which is built on top
 of the DelayedArray framework and has shown excellent performance 
relevant to existing (hdf5-based) solution. Finally, usage of TileDB
